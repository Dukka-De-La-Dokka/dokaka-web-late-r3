## GitHub as a Post-Pandemic Survival Wisdom
This is a musician's website, who is eager to utilize GitHub as a Post-Pandemic Survival Wisdom. (GPSW)
I have launched GitHub branch in order to catch up with the lastest IT technology, and I believe that GitHub gonna really be helpful for living after pandemic world.
If you want to know more about me, please review my Wiki in this repository or visit my website.

## What's New
<span style="color: #e29623; font-size: 20px;">&#9770;&#9770;&#9770;&#9770;</span>  
Dark mode / Light mode auto detection, v4.1 has been released.
The theme will be changed depending on your system default color, as well as toggled by the user.  
The theme - Maroon - was created by the inspiration of my favorite Japanese train color - [近鉄マルーン 阪急マルーン](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=%E8%BF%91%E9%89%84%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3+%E9%98%AA%E6%80%A5%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3&iax=images&ia=images)

## Next step
* Study how to stop running CI/CD after editted README.md on the remote repository.
* It seems like `prefers-color-scheme` only reflects system color mode, therefore if toggled by the user, `prefers-color-scheme` can not judge which color is currently being active. I'm gonna read through [here](https://theme-ui.com/color-modes/) and [here](https://www.jscodetips.com/examples/how-to-override-css-prefers-color-scheme-setting) for the next release.
